    "# Implementing Statistics with Functions - Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction \n",
    "In this lab you'll dive deep into calculating the measures of central tendency and dispersion introduced in previous lessons. You will code the formulas for these functions in Python which will require you to use the programming skills that you have gained in the other lessons of this section. Let's get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Calculate the measures of dispersion for a dataset\n",
    "* Compare the different measures of dispersion\n",
    "* Calculate the measures of central tendency for a dataset\n",
    "* Compare the different measures of central tendency\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "For this lab, we'll use the [NHIS dataset](http://people.ucsc.edu/~cdobkin/NHIS%202007%20data.csv), which contains weights, heights, and some other attributes for a number of surveyed individuals. The context of this survey is outside the scope this lab, so we'll just go ahead and load the heights column as a list for us to run some simple statistical experiments. We'll use the `pandas` library to import the data into our Python environment. This process will be covered in detail in a later section. For now, we'll do this part for you to give you a head start.  \n",

    " - You can use integer division `//` to calculate the index -- for even numbers this just means that the result is an integer (e.g. `4 // 2` is `2` rather than `2.0`), while for odd numbers this means that the remainder is cut off (e.g. `7 // 2` is `3`, not `3.5`)"
